⚠️ solana-go works using SemVer but in 0 version, which means that the 'minor' will be changed when some broken changes are introduced into the application, and the 'patch' will be changed when a new feature with new changes is added or for bug fixing. As soon as v1.0.0 be released, solana-go will start to use SemVer as usual.
